  <h1>Hello! I'm Marcin</h1>
  <p>I'm learning Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I focus on creating my own websites, as well as small browser extensions and web tools to make online tasks faster and more enjoyable.</p>
  
  <h2>Browser Extensions</h2>
  <p>Small extensions designed to make certain online tasks quicker, easier, and more enjoyable. I enjoy creating practical solutions without automating gameplay or violating site rules.</p>
  
  <h2>Web Tools & Sites</h2>
  <p>Tools and websites for automating and optimizing various tasks online, from data processing to interactive mini-applications. My goal is to make useful tools accessible and easy to use.</p>
  
  <h2>Support My Work</h2>
  <p>All my tools are completely free to use. If you find them helpful, you can support me voluntarily by buying me a coffee. Your support helps me continue creating more extensions and web tools.</p>
